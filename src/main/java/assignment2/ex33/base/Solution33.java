Exercise 33 - Magic 8 Ball
Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program. If you combine that with a random number generator, you
can pick a random entry from this list, which works great for games.

Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and then displays either "Yes," "No," "Maybe," or "Ask again
later."

Example Output
What's your question?
> Will I be rich and famous?

Ask again later.
Constraint
The value should be chosen randomly using a pseudo random number generator. Store the possible choices in a list and
select one at random.
Challenges
Implement this as a GUI application.
If available, use native device libraries to allow you to “shake” the 8 ball.
